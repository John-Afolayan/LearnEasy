Our application uses Firebase for the database to store chats and to authenticate users. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use and has sped up our development process significantly.
